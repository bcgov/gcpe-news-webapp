GCPE News WebApp
======================

OpenShift Configuration and Deployment
----------------

The gcpe-news-tools (Tools) project contains the Build Configurations (bc) and Image Streams (is) that are referenced by the Deployment Configurations.

The following projects contain the Deployment Configurations (dc) for the various types of deployments:
- gcpe-news-dev (Development)
- gcpe-news-test (Test)
- gcpe-news-prod (Production)
 

Steps to configure the project:
----------------------------------

Ensure that you have access to the build and deployment templates.

These can be found in the OpenShift/Templates folder of the project repository.

If you are setting up a local OpenShift cluster for development, fork the main project.  You'll be using your own fork.

Connect to the OpenShift server using the CLI; either your local instance or the production instance. 
If you have not connected to the production instance before, use the web interface as you will need to login though your GitHub account.  Once you login you'll be able to get the token you'll need to login to you project(s) through the CLI.

The same basic procedure, minus the GitHub part, can be used to connect to your local instance.

Login to the server using the oc command from the page.
Switch to the Tools project by running:
`oc project gcpe-news-tools`

`oc process -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgov/gcpe-news-webapp/master/OpenShift/templates/build-template.json | oc create -f -`

This will create the objects necessary to build the product.

 You can now login to the OpenShift web interface and observe the progress of the initial build.

##Important Note - Jenkins##

The OpenShift platform will automatically create a Jenkins deployment once the pipeline build configurations are created.  This Jenkins deployment may not have access to enough metaspace memory, and may be prone to failure over time because of that.  This problem is known to occur more often if you are using the OpenShift OAUTH plugin for authentication in Jenkins, as is the standard with the BC Government Pathfinder platform.

To guard against this, add the following environment variable to the Jenkins deployment:

`JAVA_OPTS` : `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m`

You may also want to increase the RAM limits for the Jenkins deployment (4Gi recommended).  This can be done by using the "Edit Resource Limits" action menu option when viewing the deployment in the OpenShift web console.

### BDD Troubleshooting ###

The BDD tests for this project rely on gradle.  If you have problems running the functional tests (with a symptom of file not found), deleting gradlew and adding it back to the repository my resolve the issue, if the root cause is file line breaks.


**Deployment**

Once you have a valid image built, you can proceed with Deployment.

In the command prompt, type
`oc project gcpe-news-dev`

By default projects do not have permission to access images from other projects.  You will need to grant that.
Run the following:

`oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:<project_identifier>:default -n <project namespace where project_identifier needs access>`

EXAMPLE - to allow the production project access to the images, run:

`oc policy add-role-to-user system:image-puller system:serviceaccount:gcpe-news-dev:default -n gcpe-news-tools`


In the command prompt, type:
`oc process -f deployment-template.json -p DEPLOYMENT_TAG=dev | oc create -f -`

(If deploying to Test or Prod, substitute test or prod for dev as the value of DEPLOYMENT_TAG)
This command will need to be executed from the directory containing the deploymnet-template.json file in your local Repo.
'eg. C:\Repos\appname\OpenShift'

This should produce a deployment configurations and service.  
Verify that the Overview looks correct in the OpenShift web UI for the project you provisioned

You can now trigger deployments.

-Go to the Deployments page
-Select the component to deploy by clicking the name
-Click Deploy

If any builds or deployments fail, you can use the events view to see detailed errors.

SonarQube Integration 
---------------------

The tools build template contains a definition for a sonar static analysis build configuration.

OpenShift by default will do a shallow clone, which will not work with the SonarQube Git plugin, which requires a full clone.  To force OpenShift to do a full clone, explicitly set the git ref to "master".  (Do not just leave the ref field blank)

In order to run sonarqube analysis on a .csproj, the ProjectGuid field will need to be set for the .csproj and all dependent projects.  If no ProjectGuid field exists in a .csproj, create one and copy the guid value from the .sln file 
  - .sln file format is `Project("<project type>") = "<project name>", "<.csproj location", "<project Guid>"`


OpenShift Origin Notes
----------------------
When deploying to OpenShift Origin on a laptop or personal computer, there are some considerations to keep in mind.

Depending on your computer's hardware performance, you may need to increase the OpenShift timeout for communication.

Execute the following commands from a command prompt:

```oc login -u system:admin
   oc project default
   oc export dc/router -o json > router.json
```

   Edit the file router.json, and add the following environment variable:
```json
	{
		"name": "ROUTER_DEFAULT_SERVER_TIMEOUT",
		"value": "500s"
	},

```
